# Divine Defense

Make your Last Stand, survive the longest you can! \
(A GameDev.tv GameJam 2024 Submission)

This is a genre mashup of Tower Defense and a Card Game.

You have a hand of cards and can buy more in the 3 shops top-right in the screen. You have Tower and Modifier Cards. You can play the Tower cards to place Towers and the Modifier Cards can enhance the Towers.
Placing a Tower on top another same type and level Tower would upgrade the Tower to accept more Modifier cards (Level 1 - one Modifier slot, Level 2 - two modifier slots, Level 3 - three Modifier slot)
